Wildlife Animal Detection at Night Time
Overview
This repository contains a project focused on detecting wildlife animals at night time using object detection techniques. The project involves the creation of a dataset comprising images sourced from various sources. The dataset includes images of lions, tigers, leopards, and bears.

Dataset Creation
The dataset creation process involved collecting images from diverse sources to ensure a comprehensive representation of wildlife animals. These images were then annotated using the CVAT annotation tool. Annotations were meticulously crafted to accurately label the wildlife animals present in the images.

Object Detection Frameworks
The annotated dataset was utilized to train object detection models using the YOLOv8 and YOLOv9 pretrained frameworks. These frameworks are renowned for their robustness and efficiency in detecting objects in images.

Results
Upon training the YOLOv8 and YOLOv9 models on the annotated dataset, significant progress was observed in wildlife animal detection at night time. The models exhibited impressive accuracy in identifying lions, tigers, leopards, and bears, contributing to the conservation efforts and wildlife monitoring initiatives.
